# **Resonix**

Resonix is your personal, ad-free music player that gives you complete control over your collection.
Add your favorite tracks, organize them your way, and enjoy a seamless listening
experience—completely yours, with no interruptions.

## **Resonix-app**

This repository contains the **Resonix mobile app**, built with **Dart** and powered by a smooth,
intuitive UI. The goal is to provide a lightweight and customizable music experience without ads or
restrictions. ⚠️ Please note this is my first app project, so there may be bugs, issues, or unoptimized code.
